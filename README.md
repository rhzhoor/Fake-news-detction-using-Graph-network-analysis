# Fake-news-detction-using-Graph-network-analysis
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a project on Fake News Detection using two datasets. The first dataset was extracted using Twitter API, and we applied metrics in three scenarios - micro, macro, and meso. The second dataset is the Buzzfeed news dataset, a labeled dataset, to which we applied graph classification models like GNN and GAT for the detection of fake news.

This project aims to address the critical issue of fake news and provides a solution using advanced techniques like graph classification. The project demonstrates the use of Twitter API to extract data and how to apply various metrics to the data. Additionally, the project showcases the use of graph classification models like GNN and GAT to classify fake news with high accuracy.

I have put in a lot of effort to ensure the project is well-documented and the code is easily understandable, making it easy for others to build on this project or create their own fake news detection project using similar techniques.

Thank you for checking out my project.
